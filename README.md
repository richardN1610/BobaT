## Description
This project is a basic e-commerce project for a boba tea store. I chose EJS for this project because EJS is compatible with Express for back-end use as it hooks into the View engine architecture that Express provides and lets you render web pages to the client with res.render() in Express.
I used Stripe for this because there are a lot of tutorials and documentaions online about stripe js and it also handle the authentication part which save me a lot of time.
